returns a list of players, the starting decisions for each player,
substitution decisions for each player, and captain decisions for each player.
Does not select a backup gk

Selected team will cost at most budget and each player will have played at
least min_mins in past_gameweeks. sub_factors is a list containing the

the expected number of players who the captaincy will be rotated between,
